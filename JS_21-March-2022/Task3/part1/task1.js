Create a function called repeatStr2
that takes 2 string parameters,

(of the lenght of the secend string) with space betweeen it
** Important: the continue condition should be [somthing!== 0]
** Important: You should't have extra space at the end
Ex: repeatStr2("ro","cc"); => "ro ro"
Ex: repeatStr2("ro","fff"); => "ro ro ro"
